## Introduction to Ikigai
- The word "[Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)" is a [Treasure map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_map) that can help individuals find their way to discovering wonderful things about themselves that they can share with the world, and it is pronounced as "Iki-guy" [(00:00:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=43s).
- The concept of Ikigai originated from [Okinawa Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), a place known for having the most 100-year-olds in the world per capita, where 100-year-olds are revered and respected [(00:03:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=207s).

## Origins and Spread of Ikigai
- The idea of [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is not just limited to Okinawa, but can be applied globally, just like another concept from Okinawa, [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate), which has spread worldwide [(00:03:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=223s).
- Karate, which translates to "empty hand" in [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language), was invented by the [Ryukyuans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuans) as a form of self-defense after they were forbidden from having weapons by the Japanese forces in 1609 [(00:04:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=244s).
- The Okinawans used their hands as their weapons, developing a special form of self-defense that would later become known as karate [(00:04:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=266s).
- The concept of Ikigai originated from [Okinawa Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), and was introduced to the world by American soldiers who witnessed karate and learned it, eventually spreading it to the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [(00:04:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=289s).

## Meaning and Components of Ikigai
- [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is a Japanese term consisting of two words: "Iki," meaning life, and "Guy," meaning purpose, which translates to "life's purpose" [(00:05:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=317s).
- The concept of Ikigai has four directions: do what you love, do what you're good at, do what the world needs, and do what you can be rewarded for [(00:05:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=341s).
- Similar to [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate), one can earn degrees or belts in Ikigai, and it's essential to start somewhere [(00:05:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=357s).

## Personal Journey with Ikigai
- A personal experience of finding one's Ikigai is shared, where at the age of 20, a decision was made to attend music school, focusing on music aspects in life, leading to a successful career in the music industry [(00:06:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=373s).
- However, it took time to realize the true purpose behind the work, and after a year of reflection, the personal [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) was discovered to be "to delight" [(00:07:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=452s).

## Finding Your Ikigai
- The concept of Ikigai is not just about personal fulfillment but also about giving back to the world and receiving it in return [(00:08:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=483s).
- To find one's Ikigai, it's suggested to start part-time, focusing on what you love to do and what you're good at, and exploring side hustles or side projects [(00:08:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=498s).
- According to studies, up to 50% of [Millennials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials) have side hustles, which provide an opportunity to do what they're good at and love [(00:09:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=544s).
- Having a side passion or hobby can open up opportunities to transfer part-time interests into full-time pursuits and potentially earn money, but it's also possible to do a side helpful activity for personal fulfillment [(00:09:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=558s).

## Happiness and Ikigai
- According to [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) professor [Laurie R. Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos), people are generally bad at figuring out what makes them happy, and things like job, good looks, and material possessions have little impact on base level happiness [(00:09:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=589s).
- What does have an impact on happiness are things like kindness, meditation, time affluence, spending time with friends and family, and doing what one wants to do with their time [(00:10:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=610s).

## The Concept of "Key Guy"
- A "key guy" is an action or verb that involves serving, creating, delighting, nourishing, providing, teaching, healing, connecting, or building, and finding a verb that resonates with oneself can be a step towards personal fulfillment [(00:10:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=625s).
- A "key guy" can be achieved by combining time affluence, personal gifts, and rewards, and can be repeated over time to lead to a richer and more meaningful life [(00:11:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=682s).

## Living a Meaningful Life
- A meaningful life is not a destination, but something that can be enjoyed right now, and finding joy every day can add up to a lifetime of joy [(00:11:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=697s).
- Discovering one's passions, gifts, and what they love to do can help bring their "key guy" into light, and with time and effort, it's possible to earn a "black belt" in living a meaningful life [(00:11:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=716s).
- Living a meaningful life requires work, but it's worth the effort, and having a "guy map" can help guide the way [(00:12:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk-PcJS2QaU&t=730s).
